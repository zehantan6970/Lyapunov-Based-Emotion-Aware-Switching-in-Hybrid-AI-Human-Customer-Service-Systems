# Lyapunov-based Emotion Stability Switching System

This project implements a switching decision system for AI customer service based on **Lyapunov stability theory**, aiming to detect user emotional instability and decide whether to escalate from AI to human agents.

## üß† Overview

The system models the user's emotional dynamics using PAD (Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance) vectors and fits a personalized state-transition matrix $A_i$. Then, using Lyapunov stability theory, it determines whether the user's current emotional state lies inside a "safe region." If the state is outside, a switch to a human agent is triggered.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- Personalized emotional dynamics modeling with system identification
- Lyapunov-based emotion stability judgment
- Adaptive thresholding based on historical user emotions
- Integrated with DeepSeek API for synthetic dialog generation
- Evaluation via precision, recall, F1 score, switch rate, and false switch rate

## üîå DeepSeek API Integration

This project uses [DeepSeek](https://deepseek.com/) to generate synthetic emotional dialogues. Before running the generation script, configure your `.env` file with your API key:

```env
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_key_here
```

## üß™ Switching Strategies

| Strategy Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `Oracle` | Ideal, uses ground-truth switching labels |
| `A_lyapunov` | Adaptive Lyapunov-based switching using personalized user models |
| `B_fixed` | Lyapunov switching with a fixed threshold (e.g., c=3.0) |
| `C_threshold` | Simple arousal-threshold based rule (e.g., arousal > 0.7) |
| `D_none` | No switching strategy (baseline) |

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

The system is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Precision**
- **Recall** 
- **F1-score**
- **Switch Rate**
- **False Switch Rate**

### Results

| Strategy | Precision | Recall | F1 |  Switch Rate | False Switch Rate |
|----------|-----------|--------|----|-----------|--------------------|
| Oracle | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0.275 | 0.000 |
| A_lyapunov | 0.303 | 0.479 | 0.371 | 0.436 | 0.304 |
| B_fixed | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 |
| C_threshold | 0.277 | 0.438 | 0.340 | 0.436 | 0.315 |
| D_none | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 |

Analysis of D_none Strategy (No Switching)
The D_none strategy serves as a baseline control group that never predicts the need for switching (all predictions are False). This results in all key metrics being 0:

Precision = 0: No samples are predicted as True, resulting in a denominator of 0, which is set to 0
Recall = 0: No true positive samples are correctly identified since no switches are ever predicted
F1 = 0: Both Precision and Recall are 0, making F1 score also 0
Switch Rate = 0: No switches are ever predicted or triggered
False Switch Rate = 0: Since no switches are predicted, there are no false positive predictions

This baseline demonstrates the importance of having an active switching mechanism, as a passive approach (no switching) fails to capture any instances where human intervention is actually needed.
## üöÄ How to Run

1. Place all CSV and script files in the same directory.

2. Ensure you have Python ‚â•3.8 installed and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
   ```

3. Run the comparison test:
   ```bash
   python "Comparative test.py"
   ```

4. Ensure your DeepSeek key is configured in `.env` if running `deepseek_generate_text.py`.

## üéØ Conclusion

The A_lyapunov strategy achieves the best trade-off between detection precision and recall. It adapts to individual users' emotional characteristics and offers a more stable and explainable switching mechanism compared to fixed or rule-based approaches.
